# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
    demo = User.create({ username: 'demo', full_name: 'Demo', password: 'password'})
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# file = File.open('app/assets/images/instagram.png')
# post.photo.attach(io: file, filename: 'instagram.png')
